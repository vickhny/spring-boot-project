# spring-boot-project

This is a simple springboot project. I have used swagger for API self documentation, actuator for Healt check and metrics, rest-template for Consuming rest api and hystrix for api fauld tolerance in this project. I have developed the rest api which will return maximum of 5 books and maximum of 5 albums that are related to the input term. The response elements will only contain title, authors(/artists) and information whether it's a book or an album.
