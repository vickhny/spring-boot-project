# spring-boot-project

This is a simple springboot project. I have used swagger, actuator, rest-template and hystrix in this project. It will return maximum of 5 books and maximum of 5 albums that are related to the input term. The response elements will only contain title, authors(/artists) and information whether it's a book or an album.
